🚀 In My Latest Project: Event-Driven Architecture with AWS 🚀
I'm excited to share the details of my latest project, where I've implemented an event-driven architecture leveraging AWS S3, SQS, and Lambda for efficient and scalable data processing.
# **🔍 What's Involved?**

# **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service):**
S3 is used to store files and data. When a new object is uploaded to an S3 bucket, it triggers an event.

# **AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service):**
SQS acts as a message queue to decouple the components of the system. The event triggered by the S3 upload is sent to an SQS queue, ensuring reliable message delivery without loss.

# **AWS Lambda:**
Lambda functions are triggered by messages in the SQS queue. These functions process the events, perform data transformations, and invoke other services as needed.

# **🔗 How It Works:**
Raw Data Upload: Data is uploaded to an S3 bucket.

Event Trigger: The upload triggers an event.

Message Queuing: The event is sent to an SQS queue.

Serverless Processing: Lambda functions process the data from the queue.

Output Storage: The processed data is stored back in an S3 bucket.

This architecture ensures scalability, resilience, and efficiency by utilizing serverless technologies and decoupling system components. It's a game-changer for handling large-scale data processing tasks!
